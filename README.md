# Playing Video Game Using Body Pose Detection

## About the Project
The Playing Video Game Using Body Pose Detection project is a Python-based application that allows users to control a video game using their body movements. The system utilizes computer vision techniques to detect body poses and translate them into game controls. This innovative approach provides an immersive and interactive gaming experience.

## Features
- **Body Pose Detection:** Uses advanced computer vision algorithms to detect and track body poses in real-time.
- **Game Control:** Translates body movements into game controls, allowing users to interact with the game using their body.
- **Immersive Experience:** Provides a unique and engaging way to play video games without traditional controllers.

## How It Works
1. **Camera Input:** The system captures video input from a camera to detect body poses.
2. **Body Pose Detection:** The captured video frames are processed using pose detection algorithms to identify key body points.
3. **Control Mapping:** The detected body poses are mapped to specific game controls.
4. **Game Interaction:** The mapped controls are used to interact with and control the video game.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/DhanushSM/playing_videogame_usingbodypose_detection.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd playing_videogame_usingbodypose_detection
    ```
3. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```
4. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
5. Run the application:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Usage
- Ensure your camera is connected and properly configured.
- Run the application using the provided command.
- Follow the on-screen instructions to calibrate the body pose detection system.
- Start playing the video game using your body movements as controls.
